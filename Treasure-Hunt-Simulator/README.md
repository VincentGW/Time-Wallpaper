A fun game involving tiles and coordinates where a traveler searches for lost artifacts. Think Wind Waker meets Microsoft Excel bu it's 1990.



Keep "Functions.py" in the same folder as "Game.py" and run "Game.py". Required: pip install pygame.



Controls:


Arrow keys: Move map cursor
Return: View inventory (or interact with dialogue)
Spacebar: Look around/Fish (or interact with dialogue)
'A': View Atlas (once aquired)



TODO: (Fix) If you spawn in a landlocked place and are unable to move, just restart the game.
